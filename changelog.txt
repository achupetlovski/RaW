//This should some day probably look like a file editor

First edit, added open file

Note that at the moment it works with only one single file at a time!


Second commit/edit, can now save file as well


Third commit

Tabs now working as expected, all save/read/write functions work fine.

Text window now fits to size ( stretches to fit ) the size of the tab, so you can resize your window.


Forth

You can now save new files
