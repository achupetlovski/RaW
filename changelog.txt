//This should some day probably look like a file editor

First edit, added open file

Note that at the moment it works with only one single file at a time!


Second commit/edit, can now save file as well


Third commit

Tabs now working as expected, all save/read/write functions work fine.

Text window now fits to size ( stretches to fit ) the size of the tab, so you can resize your window.


Forth

You can now save new files


Coloring is done for the ~22 lua keywords. You need to enable the option from the Tools bar for that.
It currently works on new words and breaks formatting if you enable it on an already open text.

Looking forward to adding dynamic keyword coloring function instead soon.
